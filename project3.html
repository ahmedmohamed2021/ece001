            <h2>Genome translation</h2>
            <h3>On entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm. The
                coronavirus RNA genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a
                messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes. The host ribosomes translate the initial
                overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins,
                pp1a and pp1ab.[50]
        
                The larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC)
                and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF1a.[60] The ribosomal frameshift allows for
                the continuous translation of ORF1a followed by ORF1b.[50]
        
                The polyproteins have their own proteases, PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5), which cleave the polyproteins at
                different specific sites. The cleavage of polyprotein pp1ab yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16).
                Product proteins include various replication proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), RNA helicase
                (nsp13), and exoribonuclease (nsp14)</h3>

            <h2>Replicase-transcriptase</h2>
            <h3>A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex. The
                main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is directly involved in the
                replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand. The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist
                in the replication and transcription process. The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides
                extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
                lacks.[61]
        
                Replication – One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates
                the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This is followed by the
                replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA Transcription – The other
                important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of
                negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This process is followed by the
                transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.[50]
                The subgenomic mRNAs form a "nested set" which have a common 5'-head and partially duplicate 3'-end.[62]
        
                Recombination – The replicase-transcriptase complex is also capable of genetic recombination when at least two
                viral genomes are present in the same infected cell.[62] RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force
                in determining genetic variability within a coronavirus species, the capability of a coronavirus species to jump
                from one host to another and, infrequently, in determining the emergence of novel coronaviruses.[63] The exact
                mechanism of recombination in coronaviruses is unclear, but likely involves template switching during genome
                replication.</h3>

            <h2>Assembly and release</h2>
            <h3>The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses. The mRNAs are gene
                transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame. These mRNAs are
                translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and many accessory proteins.[50] RNA translation
                occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory
                pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment. There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions
                required for the assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid. Progeny viruses are then
                released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles. Once released the viruses can infect other
                host cells</h3>
            <hr />
            <h2>Transmission</h2>
            <h3>Infected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment. The interaction of the coronavirus spike
                protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and
                species range of the released virus.[65][66] Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells.[43] They are
                transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite,
                or fecal-oral route.[67]
        
                Human coronaviruses infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, while animal coronaviruses generally
                infect the epithelial cells of the digestive tract.[43] SARS coronavirus, for example, infects the human
                epithelial cells of the lungs via an aerosol route[68] by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
                receptor.[69] Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infects the pig epithelial cells of the digestive
                tract via a fecal-oral route[67] by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase (APN) receptor</h3>

            <h2>Classification</h2>
            <h3>Coronaviruses form the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae,[3][4][5] which is one of two sub-families in the family
                Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.[43][70] They are divided into the four genera:
                Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronaviruses and
                betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds </h3>
