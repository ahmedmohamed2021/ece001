    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <h3>The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000
        BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term
        coevolution with bat and avian species.[73] The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has
        been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800
        BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an
        ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and
        betacoronavirus â€“ and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and
        global range of bat and avian species that host viruses have enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of
        coronaviruses.
        Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats.[75] The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with
        a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE.[76] The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor
        with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE.[77] More recently, alpaca coronavirus and
        human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.[78] MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the
        intermediate host of camels.[79] MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have
        diverged from these several centuries ago.[80] The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in
        1986.[81] The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae; subsequently,
        they spread to horseshoe bats in the species Rhinolophidae, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans

    <h2>Infection in humans</h2>
    <h3>Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as
        MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.[50] Coronaviruses can cause colds with
        major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.[91] Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia
        (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis
        or secondary bacterial bronchitis).[92] The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe
        acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory
        tract infections.[92]

        Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making
        seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.</h3>
