    <h2>Coronaviruses</h2>
    <h3>are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause
        respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of
        the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties
        can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
        encephalomyelitis.
        Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and
        realm Riboviria.[4][5] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a
        nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[6] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32
        kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.[7] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project
        from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which
        their name derives.[8]</h3>
